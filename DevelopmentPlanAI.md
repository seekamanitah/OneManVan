### Expanded AI-Friendly Development Plan for TradeFlow FSM: Personal HVAC Job Estimator App

This expanded guide builds on the initial AI-assisted development blueprint for TradeFlow FSM, your personal HVAC estimator app for residential services like furnace installations, AC repairs, and ductwork tune-ups. Designed for solo use, it emphasizes quick estimates from customer assets (e.g., serial-tracked condensers with BTU/fuel details), inventory pulls, basic scheduling, time logging, Square invoicing, and reports—with robust export/import backups (SQLite dumps or JSON subsets) for data safety on your Windows desktop or Android phone. The plan is now more granular, with sub-tasks, detailed feature breakdowns, integration specifics (e.g., Square SDK flows, Google Calendar OAuth), AI prompts for code gen/testing, and checkpoints for iterative builds. Use GitHub Copilot or Grok in Visual Studio (.NET 9) to accelerate—e.g., paste prompts into the AI chat for C#/XAML snippets, then refine with VS IntelliSense.

**Total Timeline**: 40-60 hours (desktop MVP: 25-35 hours; Android: 15-20 hours). Track progress in a VS solution with branches (e.g., `feature/custom-fields`). **AI Workflow Tips**: For features, prompt "Generate [C#/XAML] for [feature] with HVAC examples like BTU validation"; for integrations, "Implement [SDK] with error handling and offline fallback." Always test offline (e.g., mock DB) before sync. Start with a clean repo: `git init TradeFlowFSM`.

#### Prerequisites and Setup (1-2 Hours, Expanded)
- **Environment Details**: Visual Studio 2022/2025 Community—install .NET desktop/mobile workloads, Git tools. NuGets (via Package Manager): EF Core.Tools (migrations), EF Core.Sqlite/SQLServer (DB), CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (MVVM), iText7 (PDF estimates), ZXing.Net.Maui (serial scans), Microsoft.Graph (Calendar), Square.Payments (invoicing), LiveCharts2 (reports), System.Text.Json (backups). Docker Desktop for remote tests.
- **Project Granularity**: Solution (`TradeFlow.sln`) with folders:
  - `Core/Library`: Models (e.g., Customer.cs with Id, Name, Sites collection), Services (e.g., SchemaImporter.cs for JSON presets), Repositories (EF DbContext wrapper).
  - `Desktop/WPF App`: MainWindow.xaml (onboarding wizard), Pages (e.g., CustomerView.xaml).
  - `Mobile/MAUI App`: MauiProgram.cs (shared Core reference), Pages (e.g., AssetPage.xaml with camera).
  - `Presets/JSON`: HvacPreset.json (schema: `{ "Tables": [{ "Name": "Assets", "Fields": [{ "Name": "FuelType", "Type": "Enum", "Options": ["NaturalGas", "Propane", "Electric"], "Required": true }] }] }`).
  - `Tests/Unit`: xUnit for features (e.g., WarrantyCalcTests.cs).
- **DB Dual-Mode**: appsettings.json: `{ "DbMode": "Local", "LocalPath": "TradeFlow.db", "RemoteConnection": "Server=localhost,1433;Database=TradeFlow;User=sa;Password=..." }`. Docker: `docker-compose.yml` with SQL Server volume (`./data:/var/opt/mssql` for persistence).
- **AI Prompt Starter**: "Create .NET solution structure: Core lib with EF DbContext for Customers/Assets (base schema), Desktop WPF app with wizard for trade selection (load JSON preset, apply migration), Mobile MAUI stub. Include appsettings.json for DB toggle and basic export service (SQLite dump to JSON)."
- **Checkpoint**: Solution builds (Ctrl+Shift+B); wizard runs, creates empty DB. Commit "setup-v1".

#### Phase 1: Core Foundation and Trade Customization (8-10 Hours, Expanded)
Establish schema engine, wizard, and dynamic UI—ensuring HVAC presets load fields like BTU/fuel, with custom adder for extensibility. Features: Offline schema changes; backups include configs.

- **Task 1: Schema Engine and Migrations (3-4 hours)**.
  - **Feature Breakdown**: Generic base tables (Customers: Id, Name, Addresses collection; Assets: Id, CustomerId FK, Serial (unique), Model, InstallDate). Preset importer: Parse JSON → Generate EF migration (e.g., AddFuelType enum column). Custom fields: `CustomFields` table (EntityId FK, Key, Type: Text/Enum/Number/Date, Value); validation (e.g., BTU >12k regex).
  - **Integration Details**: EF Core.Tools for migrations (`dotnet ef migrations add HvacPreset`); runtime apply via `context.Database.MigrateAsync()`. Offline: Local migrations only; sync queues schema diffs to Docker.
  - **Backup Tie-In**: Export serializes schema (e.g., `JsonSerializer.Serialize(customFields)`); import runs reverse migration if needed.
  - **AI Prompt**: "Expand EF DbContext: Base Assets table with Serial/Model. Add JsonSchemaImporter service: Load HvacPreset.json, create migration for fields (FuelType enum: NaturalGas/Propane/Electric, BTU int with validation >12000). Include CustomFields table for no-code adds (Type enum: Text/Enum). Generate test migration script."
  - **Sub-Test**: Run preset import → Query DB for new columns (e.g., LINQ: `context.Assets.FirstOrDefault(a => a.FuelType == "Propane")`).

- **Task 2: Onboarding Wizard and UI Adaptation (2-3 hours)**.
  - **Feature Breakdown**: 4-step wizard: Step 1: Trade dropdown (HVAC/General) → Step 2: Preset preview (list new fields like Config enum) → Step 3: DB toggle (Local test button pings SQLite; Remote: Validate Docker connection via `SqlConnection.Open()`) → Step 4: Save config, apply migration, launch Home.
  - **Integration Details**: MVVM: WizardViewModel with RelayCommands (e.g., `LoadPresetCommand` calls importer). UI: Dynamic forms via DataTemplates (e.g., Enum field renders ComboBox if HVAC active).
  - **Backup Tie-In**: Wizard exports initial config JSON on complete.
  - **AI Prompt**: "WPF Wizard XAML + ViewModel: Stepper control for trade select (dropdown loads presets), preview grid of fields (e.g., BTU for HVAC), DB toggle with connection test (SqliteConnection vs SqlConnection). Bind dynamic form templates (e.g., Enum ComboBox for FuelType)."
  - **Sub-Test**: Select HVAC → Verify form shows BTU slider; toggle remote → Ping succeeds.

- **Task 3: Backup/Sync Engine Basics (3 hours)**.
  - **Feature Breakdown**: Export button: Options (Full DB, Trade Subset like "HVAC Assets", Schema Only); formats (SQLite .db, JSON with custom fields). Import: Parse/merge (e.g., upsert customers, prompt conflicts like "Overwrite BTU?").
  - **Integration Details**: Service: `BackupService` with `ExportAsync` (EF to Json, ZipFile for encryption). Sync: `SyncQueue` table (ChangeType: Insert/Update, Payload JSON); TimerService polls Docker every 5min if remote toggled.
  - **Backup Tie-In**: Core function—e.g., auto-export on schema change.
  - **AI Prompt**: "C# BackupService: Export EF context to SQLite dump or JSON (serialize Assets with custom fields like FuelType). Import method with upsert (conflict prompt via MessageBox). Add SyncQueue table and Timer for remote push (HttpClient to Docker API endpoint)."
  - **Sub-Test**: Add asset → Export JSON → Import to new DB → Verify FuelType preserved.

**Expanded Checkpoint**: Wizard applies HVAC preset; custom field adds "SEER Rating" → Appears in asset form. Offline export works. Commit "v0.1-Foundation" with branch for customs.
