Here is a compiled list of major HVAC brands commonly used in residential and commercial applications across the United States, 
along with their official warranty registration websites. I focused on well-established brands based on industry recognition 
(e.g., from sources like Forbes, Consumer Reports, and manufacturer directories). Note that warranty registration often requires 
details like model/serial numbers, installation date, and installer information, and some brands may require registration within 
60-90 days of installation for extended coverage. Always verify the latest terms on the site, as policies can change.

I organized this into a table for clarity:
